    <h1>Sergi Asins</h1>
    It's not about how many times you fall, but how many times you get up.

I studied at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, where I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Food Science and Technology. The tesis was done in the Transgenetycs Plant Laboratori (Biomolecular Institute of Cells and Plants at the UPV). Since then, I have worked in leading companies in the agri-food sector.

I believe in continuous trainning and personal improvement. Therefore, throughout my professional career, I have never give up studying. My last studies are the Professional Training in Computer Security - ICFT0109; Professional Trainningin Certified level 3.

I also hold a Master's degree in Secondary and Language Teaching, a Master's degree in Renewable Energies and Master's degree in Business Administration. I speak english (advanced) and French, in addition to my two native languages.

In my most recent experience, I have worked for 3 years in Marrakech as a Quality Manager at Sunpack, an expanding citrus export company. This opportunity allowed me to develop professionally by acquiring new skills such as innovating in a small and growing business environment, leading small teams, training new employees, managing data, and manage the agri-food quality technical department.

Currently, I would like to be part of projects that truly inspire me. I consider myself versatile, but my strongest points are my ability to learn and my perseverance in achieving my goals.
